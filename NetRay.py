"""
    NetRay Main module.
    This module is the manager module.
    It organizes everything that is needed in order to detect attacks in a given decrypted pcap parsed to a json file.
    Execution Flow:
        *Validate paths and user input.
        *Initialize a logger.
        *Deserialize json file.
        *Create a list with each packet as a dictionary.
        *Executes attack detection modules that in ATTACK_DETECTIONS_TO_EXECUTE.
        *Log attack detections to console.

    In order to expand the tool, all you need to do is:
        1.Write an attack detection module.
        2.Import the module here.
        3.Add the class name to ATTACK_DETECTIONS_TO_EXECUTE list.

    Attack detection modules can be found in externals files, example - silverticket.py.
