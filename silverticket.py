    This module detects Silver Ticket Attack.
    Info about Silver Ticket:
    https://www.cyberark.com/blog/service-accounts-weakest-link-chain/
    https://adsecurity.org/?p=2011

    Silver ticket is an attack that takes place after an attacker compromise a service key / password.
    With that key an attacker can create and send a forged service ticket at ap-req.
    In the service ticket the attacker can change which groups they belong to
    and also can use a none exists username in order to elevate his privileges.

    The attack is detected by verify the privsvr (KRBTGT) signature.
    The privsvr signature is  a checksum of the server signature field encrypted with KRBTGT key.

    Thanks to CoreSecurity Impacket for doing a great job around the crypto and Kerberos.
